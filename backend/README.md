- Unregistered clients can only view the food truck card without price or availability. 
- Registered clients can search and view details of the trucks, as well as create request through a form.
- Registered owners can register food trucks and a presentation profile to offer their services and receive requests.

## Backlog

- Responsive design

- Add the option to create comments and reviews about food trucks and owners as well as having the option to add to favorites. So we could create recommendations for the user

- Sort by reviews, price...

- Implement passport and social log in

- Create the direct messaging option within the application

- Pay reservation

- Interact with other users 

- Edit password with email validation
